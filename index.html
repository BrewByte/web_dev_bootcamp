      <b> Dario Marianelli </b>is an acclaimed Italian composer who has left
      an indelible mark on film scoring over the past two decades. Born in
      Pisa in 1963, he honed his craft studying piano and composition before
      breaking through by scoring the 2000 film Warrior. However, it was his
      lush, romantic score for the 2005 Pride & Prejudice that truly
      announced Marianelli's arrival, earning him an Academy Award and BAFTA
      Award. He has since become a go-to composer for literary adaptations
      and period dramas, with his evocative scores for films like Atonement,
      Anna Karenina, and collaborations with directors Joe Wright and Keira
      Knightley blending traditional orchestral writing with modern textures
      and unusual instrumentation. Marianelli's ability to capture the
      emotional essence of a story through his music has garnered him
      additional Oscar and BAFTA nominations, cementing his status as one of
      the most impactful and versatile film composers of his generation.

   <h2>Biography</h2>
   <hr>
   <p>Dario Marianelli (born 21 June 1963) is an Italian composer known for his frequent collaborations with director
      Joe Wright.

      Marianelli had already written scores for several films and TV projects, including movies such as Ailsa and
      Pandaemonium, when director Joe Wright contacted him about scoring his 2005 film Pride & Prejudice. He
      subsequently composed for Wright's films Atonement, The Soloist, Anna Karenina and Darkest Hour.

      In 2008 Marianelli won the Academy Award for Original Music Score and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score
      for Atonement. He has also been nominated for Academy Awards for Pride & Prejudice and Anna Karenina.

      In 2018 he composed the score for Bumblebee, the sixth installment in the Transformers film series. It was his
      second score for director Travis Knight, after Kubo and the Two Strings.

      Marianelli has continued to write concert, theatre and ballet music. In a 2019 article on film composing, he said:
      "Writing music professionally is a hard occupation, and writing for media definitely not for the fainthearted. One
      has to be able to enjoy the pain, in order to be able to carry on successfully. I think one of the hardest things
      to deal with, working as a composer involved in media, is the anxiety that comes from being in quite a vulnerable
      position.</p>
